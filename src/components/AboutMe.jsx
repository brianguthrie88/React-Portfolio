    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Brian Guthrie. I was born and I currently live
        in Columbia, SC. I graduated from the University of South
        Carolina with a Bachelors in Media Arts and I also minored
        in Computer Science. I currently am completing a web development
        bootcamp course because I would like a career change and the course 
        was the most logical thing for me time wise and money wise. I want
        to explore this topic and become better at it because I love to design.
        That is why I got into media arts, because computers and art are two things
        that I am good at using and creating. Sadly, my career in media arts did not
        turn out like I hoped so this web development journey, hopefully will
        be a better one. I am very motivated to learn this new skill and 
        very determined to get to the place I need to be in order to one day
        be a professional in this field. Please enjoy looking at all of the 
        websites I have created through my Portfolio. Thank you.
