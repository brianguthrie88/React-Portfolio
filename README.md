# React-Portfolio

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

WHEN I load the portfolio

THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer

WHEN I view the header

THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio

WHEN I view the navigation titles

THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

WHEN I click on a navigation title

THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted

WHEN I load the portfolio the first time

THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default

WHEN I am presented with the About Me section

THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them

WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section

THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section

THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message

WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text

THEN I receive a notification that this field is required

WHEN I enter text into the email address field

THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address

WHEN I am presented with the Resume section

THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

WHEN I view the footer

THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

## Description
My motivation for this project was to take my already created portfolio website using html, and css, and modifying it to incorporate react. This in turn would display my skills using that javascript library, such as creating components and using useState. Users will be able to view my about me, work and contact pages.
